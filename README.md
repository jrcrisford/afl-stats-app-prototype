# AFL Stats App Prototype  
**KIT305 / KIT721 – Assignment 1: Prototyping and Usability Testing**

This repository contains the low-fidelity prototype and supporting documentation for a mobile app designed to record statistics during AFL (Australian Football League) matches. The prototype was created as part of Assignment 1 for the University of Tasmania units KIT305/KIT721 Mobile Application Development.

## Project Overview

The goal of the app is to allow officials to efficiently record real-time player actions during local AFL matches. The design focuses on usability, speed, and clarity under pressure, aligning with user-centered design principles. Features include match creation, player stat tracking, team score summaries, and quarter-based breakdowns.

This project includes:
- A first version of the prototype used during usability testing
- A revised version based on user feedback
- A report detailing the design process and usability testing

## Folder Structure

- `Prototype Wireframes/` – Contains Balsamiq mockups of the original and revised prototypes
- `Report Images/` – Screenshots and visual elements included in the report
- `Usability Testing Summaries/` – Notes and results from think-aloud testing sessions
- `KIT305 AT1 Report.docx` – Full report detailing design principles, testing process, and outcomes

## Key Features Represented in the Prototype

- Match setup and team management
- Real-time stat tracking (kick, handball, mark, tackle, goal, behind)
- Score tracking with AFL-style formatting (Goals . Behinds = Total)
- Quarter tracking and end-of-quarter breakdowns
- Player stat summaries and team comparisons
- Match history and plain text export concept

## Tools Used

- Balsamiq Wireframes for low-fidelity prototyping
- Microsoft Word for the assignment report
- Manual usability testing with five participants using the think-aloud protocol

## Notes

- This is a **prototype only** — no functional code or backend is implemented.
- The project was designed to meet the requirements outlined in the 2025 assignment theme and brief.
- No generative AI was used in the creation of this submission, as per assignment restrictions.
